#Energy efficient Fragmentation-Aware Routing Modulation Spectrum and Core Allocation Algorithms for Survivable Space Division Multiplexed Elastic Optical Networks.
Developed algorithms to enhance the performance of Space Division Multiplexed Elastic Optical
Networks (SDM-EONs) using multi-core fibers. The project focused on designing energy-efficient
Routing, Modulation, Spectrum,  and Core Allocation (RMSCA) algorithms that minimize power
consumption and inter-core cross-talk. Addressed the challenge of link failures (fiber-cuts) by
creating robust algorithms for network survivability. Additionally,  implemented strategies to
manage spectrum fragmentation in a dynamic environment where connection requests  are
random. The algorithms ensure efficient data propagation with high bandwidth while
maintaining network resilience and optimizing resource allocation.
